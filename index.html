      <div id="aboutPDiv">
        I started playing the trumpet when I was 9 years old. I am classically trained. Discovering my passion for music at a young age allowed me to pursue a wide range of musical experiences and encounters with musicians from every imaginable music genre that ultimately helped me to understand what I wanted to accomplish as a performer. I have performed with symphonies, small jazz groups, concert bands, large swing bands, musical theatre, in nightclubs (oh yeah…also strip clubs), in lounges, backing up vocalists, at weddings, private parties, dances, and doing studio work.<span id="break"><br></span> My music playing preference? Lead trumpet with small combos and playing good music with good musicians for all occasions, from jazz standards, to show tunes, Latin, blues and light classical. But I’ll consider any good music opportunity. I am not influenced by any particular trumpet player or style ofplaying. I just play the best trumpet I can and tailor the style for each musical occasion. I have good playing skills and I read well. I like to play with a congenial group of musicians who are as passionate as I am about having fun making good music, and being as good as we can be. I live in Vancouver, Canada, but have dual Canadian – United States Citizenship and can work freely in either country within driving distance from Vancouver, B.C.
